## App download

To download the target ".apk" file, go to [releases](https://github.com/DominikKwiatkowski/FaceRecognition/releases/tag/v1.0.0). App is compatible with Android OS 8.0 and above.

## Project download

To download and modify the project according to your needs, use `git clone https://github.com/DominikKwiatkowski/FaceRecognition` and open it with Android Studio. It will download all required libraries through Gradle.

## Addition of new model

To add new face recognition model, add it with `.tflite` extension to `/app/src/main/ml` directory like presented below:

To make the model visible in the app options, add new entry to `/app/src/main/res/values/arrays.xml`, like presented below:

Norm is algorithm used to calculate distance between feature vectors generated by the model.
Threshold is the maximum distance between two vectors representing features of the same face.
